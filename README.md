### Project Description
 To create a simple and functional egg timer using HTML,CSS,java Script.The timer will allow users  to set a countdown and get notified when time is up. 

### The Problem statement
Many people struggle with boiling eggs to the desired consistency due to inaccurate timing, leading to undercooked or overcooked eggs. The Egg Boiler Timer website provides a precise, user-friendly and automated solution by offering preset timers for different types of eggs. 

### The Solution
Imagine this: You put an egg to boil, get distracted by your phone, and suddenly… OOPS! Rubbery egg? Runny mess? Explosion?? (Okay, maybe not that bad, but still annoying!). In the Egg Boiler Timer, you get ; 
    One-Click Precision
    No More Forgetting
    Attention-Grabbing Alerts
    Cool & Fun UI 
With the Egg Boiler Timer, you can crack the code to the perfect egg, every single time!

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
1️⃣ Create the Project Folder
Make a new folder on your computer and name it Egg-Boiler-Timer.

2️⃣ Create Required Files
Inside the folder, create three files:
index.html (for structure)
styles.css (for styling)
script.js (for functionality)

3️⃣ Add the Code
Copy and paste the HTML code into index.html.
Move the CSS styles into styles.css (if not already inline).
Copy the JavaScript functions into script.js and link it in index.html.

4️⃣ Run the Website Locally
Open index.html in a browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
OR use VS Code's Live Server for a smoother experience.

5️⃣ Deploy Online (Optional)
Upload to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to make it available online.

# Run
1️⃣ Locate Your Project Folder – Find the folder where your website files (HTML, CSS, JS) are stored.

2️⃣ Open the HTML File – Double-click on the index.html file to open it in your web browser.

3️⃣ Use a Code Editor (Optional) – If you want to edit or run the project in a developer-friendly environment, open the folder in a code editor like VS Code.

4️⃣ Run with Live Server (Optional) – In VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension to refresh the page automatically when you make changes.

5️⃣ Use a Local Server (Optional) – If you need to test it as a hosted webpage, you can start a simple local server using a tool like Python or Node.js.

6️⃣ Enjoy Your Egg Timer! – Click the buttons to select the egg type, watch the countdown, and wait for the alarm to notify you when your eggs are ready!

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
![alt text](Intial_stage.png)
This image shows the initial stage of an Egg Timer Web App. The interface allows users to select different types of egg preparations with predefined cooking times, such as Soft Boiled (5 min), Medium Boiled (7 min), Hard Boiled (10 min), Baked Egg (12 min), and Bull’s Eye Egg (8 min). The timer is displayed at 00:00, indicating that it has not started yet. Below the timer, there are three buttons:

Test Alarm: To check the alarm sound.
Reset Timer: To reset the timer to its default state.
Stop Alarm: To stop the alarm when it rings.
The design features a warm orange-red background, rounded buttons, and emoji icons for better user experience.

![alt text](Timer_running.png)
This image shows the Egg Timer Web App in action, with the timer actively counting down. The user has selected the Soft Boiled (5 min) option, and the countdown is at 4 minutes and 29 seconds remaining. The interface remains the same, but the selected option is highlighted. The background features an egg-themed design, reinforcing the app's purpose. The control buttons (Test Alarm, Reset Timer, and Stop Alarm) are still available for user interaction.

![alt text](Alarm_rings.png)
This image shows the Egg Timer Web App at the completion of the countdown. The timer has reached 00:00, and a message, "Egg is ready!!!", is displayed prominently, indicating that the selected egg type has finished cooking. The interface remains the same, with the selected Soft Boiled (5 min) option still highlighted. The control buttons (Test Alarm, Reset Timer, Stop Alarm) are available, allowing the user to reset or stop the alarm if needed. The background features a fried egg illustration, reinforcing the cooking theme.

# Diagrams

The workflow begins when the user opens the website, and the webpage loads. The user is then prompted to select the type of egg they want to boil. The available options include Soft Boiled (5 min), Medium Boiled (7 min), Hard Boiled (10 min), Baked (12 min), and Bull’s Eye (8 min). Once an option is selected, the timer starts the countdown. If the timer has not yet reached zero, it continues running. Once the timer reaches zero, the system plays an alarm sound and displays a popup message informing the user that their egg is ready.

After the timer ends, the user has the option to take additional actions. They can either test the alarm manually, reset the timer, or stop the alarm if it is playing. If no additional actions are taken, the workflow ends.

This flowchart visually represents the entire process of the Egg Boiler Timer, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience for users.

### Project Demo
# Video
<video controls src="Egg Boiler Timer - Google Chrome 2025-02-09 10-09-26.mp4" title="Title"></video>
The video demonstrates the functionality of the Egg Timer Website by showcasing its user interface and how it operates. When the webpage loads, the user is presented with different egg cooking options, such as **Soft Boiled, Medium Boiled, Hard Boiled, Baked Egg, and Bull’s Eye Egg**. Each option has a predefined cooking time, and the user can start the timer by clicking on their preferred choice. Once selected, the countdown begins, displaying the remaining time in a bold and prominent manner. 

As the timer progresses, the display continuously updates in real time until it reaches 0:00. At this moment, an alarm sound is triggered, accompanied by a message stating "Egg is ready!!!", alerting the user that the chosen egg type has finished cooking. The video likely also demonstrates additional functionalities such as the ability to test the alarm sound, reset the timer back to 00:00, or manually stop the alarm if needed. The background may feature a visually appealing egg-themed animation or video to enhance user engagement. Overall, the video provides a seamless walkthrough of the website's interactive features, demonstrating how users can efficiently use the timer for perfectly cooked eggs.
